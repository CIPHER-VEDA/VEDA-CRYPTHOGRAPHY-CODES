🔐 VEDA Cryptography Codes
A collection of cryptographic algorithm implementations in Java, designed for learning and experimentation. This repository includes fundamental encryption, decryption, and key exchange algorithms widely used in cybersecurity and cryptography.

📜 Included Algorithms
Caesar Cipher – A simple substitution cipher for encryption and decryption.
Hill Cipher – A polygraphic substitution cipher based on matrix operations.
Playfair Cipher – A digraph substitution cipher for securing text messages.
Simplified DES (SDES) – A reduced version of the Data Encryption Standard for educational purposes.
Simplified AES – A lightweight implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard.
RSA Algorithm – A widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm based on prime factorization.
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange – A secure method for key agreement over an insecure channel.

🚀 Usage
These implementations are for educational purposes and can be used to understand cryptographic concepts. You can compile and execute each Java file using any standard Java development environment.
